    "Stage 3 imaging (Image3, calwebb_image3) processing is intended for combining the calibrated data from multiple exposures (e.g., a dither or mosaic pattern) into a single distortion corrected product.

It is also possible use a single \"cal\" file as input, in which case only the resample and source_catalog steps will be applied.\n",

    "> **Outputs**: A resampled/rectified 2D image product with suffix \"i2d\" is created, containing the rectified single exposure or the rectified and combined association of exposures (the direct output of the resample step). A source catalog produced from the \"i2d\" product is saved as an ASCII file in \"ecsv\" format, with a suffix of \"cat\". If the outlier_detection step is applied, a new version of each input calibrated exposure product is created, which contains a DQ array that has been updated to flag pixels detected as outliers. This updated product is known as a CR-flagged product and the file is identified by including the association candidate ID in the original input \"cal\" file name and changing the suffix to \"crf\".\n",

The background subtraction (bkg_subtract) step can only be executed when the pipeline is supplied with an association of exposures, because it relies on multiple exposures to perform their tasks. The ASN file must not only list the input exposures, but must also contain information that indicates their relationships to one another. Background subtraction for Wide-Field Slitless Spectroscopy (WFSS) exposures is accomplished by scaling and subtracting a master background image from a CRDS reference file.\n",

A 1D extracted spectral data product, which is saved as a \"x1d\" or \"x1dints\" file, depending on the input type.
