    "### What is Conda?\n",
    "\n",
    "Conda is the direct successor to Ureka, the previous STScI software package system. Conda is an open source package and environment management system that runs on Windows, macOS and Linux. It installs, runs and updates packages and their dependencies. It also creates, saves, loads and switches between environments on your local computer. It was created for Python programs, but it can package and distribute software for any language. [Click here](https://conda.io/docs/index.html) to read more about Conda.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Which Conda?\n",
    "\n",
    "STScI's software is compatible with both the Miniconda and Anaconda distributions. Miniconda includes only Conda's root environment and it's dependencies (it's the fastest way to install Conda). Anaconda is Continuum Analytics Inc.’s flagship product that provides a full-featured Conda root environment plus more than 720 useful tools, libraries, and utilities. The example below will show you how to install the Miniconda version.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What are environments?\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose you have a program that requires an older version of Python or photutils, but you also want to be able to run the version that is required for the JWST pipeline. With Conda, you can have both – it allows you to easily set up and manage environments that have different versions of Python and/or other packages installed in them. To access a particular version of software, simply switch to that environment. Environments allow you to use or update software in one environment without breaking anything in your other environments. This is particularly important for software that is in development (e.g., JWST pipeline or JWST data analysis tools), as it often requires specific versions of packages in order to run. [Click here](https://conda.io/docs/user-guide/tasks/manage-environments.html) to read more about environments.\n"
